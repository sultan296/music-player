# music-player

I present a fully functional music player created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The music player features a visually appealing interface complete with a song thumbnail, song name, and artist name. Users can play or pause the song, interact with a custom progress bar, and control playback with intuitive icons for backward, play, and forward actions. This project highlights the seamless integration of multimedia elements using code, allowing anyone to easily implement a music player on their own website.
